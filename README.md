RTMPS client for league of legends built in go

This is incomplete, but works mostly. All of the hard work has been done. There could be a lot better error handling, documentation, and code clean up, but with the release of the official API my work on this project has ended. I am putting it up incase anyone is curious to see how I did it. Potentially someone could use this code as a foundation for a custom league client built in Go. 

Anyways, if anyone has any questions let me know.

Huge thanks to the lolrtmpsclient java library (https://code.google.com/p/lolrtmpsclient/). I referenced it immensly while trying to get this to work. A lot of the low level code is more or less just the java implemnetation ported to Go.
